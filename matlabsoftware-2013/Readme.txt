Put all the files of the toolbox in a directory and add them to the Matlab path.
Run the ex1.m file in order to read an image 'cell.tif', despeckle it and then to 
calculate 61 different texture features and 16 image quality evaluation metrics from
the original and despeckled images. 
The features and image quality evaluation metrics are stored in matrices for further use. 
The matrices can be loaded into the matlab work space.
